# The sorted() function is different from the .sort() method in two ways:
# 1 - It comes before a list, instead of after as all built-in functions do.
# 2 - It generates a new list rather than modifying the one that already exists.
names = ["Xander", "Buffy", "Angel", "Willow", "Giles"]
sorted_names = sorted(names)
print(sorted_names)
# This yields the list sorted alphabetically: ['Angel', 'Buffy', 'Giles', 'Willow', 'Xander']
# Note that using sorted did not change names:['Xander', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'Willow', 'Giles']




games = ["Portal", "Minecraft", "Pacman", "Tetris", "The Sims", "Pokemon"]

# Your code below:
games_sorted = sorted(games)
print(games)
print(games_sorted)
