# There are some key components we want to note here: The def keyword indicates the beginning of a function (also known as a function header). The function header is followed by a name in snake_case format that describes the task the function performs. Itâ€™s best practice to give your functions a descriptive yet concise name.
# Following the function name is a pair of parenthesis ( ) that can hold input values known as parameters (more on parameters later in the lesson!). In this example function, we have no parameters.
# A colon : to mark the end of the function header.
# Lastly, we have one or more valid python statements that make up the function body (where we have our python comment).
# Your code below: 
def trip_welcome():
  print("Welcome to Tripcademy!") 
  print("Let's get you to your destination.")


def directions_to_timesSq():
  print('Walk 4 mins to 34th St Herald Square train station')
  print('Take the Northbound N, Q, R, or W train 1 stop')
  print('Get off the Times Square 42nd Street stop')
