# Functions can also return a value to the program so that this value can be modified or used later. We use the Python keyword return to do this. Here’s an example of a program that will return a converted currency for a given location a user may want to visit in our trip planner application:

def calculate_exchange_usd(us_dollars, exchange_rate):
  return us_dollars * exchange_rate

new_zealand_exchange = calculate_exchange_usd(100, 1.4)

print("100 dollars in US currency would give you " + str(new_zealand_exchange) + " New Zealand dollars")

# This would output: 100 dollars in US currency would give you 140 New Zealand dollars
#Saving our values returned from a function like we did with new_zealand_exchange allows us to reuse the value (in the form of a variable) throughout the rest of the program. When there is a result from a function that is stored in a variable, it is called a returned function value.

current_budget = 3500.75

def print_remaining_budget(budget):
  print("Your remaining budget is: $" + str(budget))

print_remaining_budget(current_budget)

# Write your code below: 

def deduct_expense(budget, expenses):
  return budget - expenses

shirt_expense = 9
new_budget_after_shirt = deduct_expense(current_budget, shirt_expense)
print_remaining_budget(new_budget_after_shirt)

#Return Multiple

# Sometimes we may want to return more than one value from a function. We can return several values by separating them with a comma. Take a look at this example of a function that allows users in our travel application to check the upcoming week’s weather (starting on Monday):
weather_data = ['Sunny', 'Sunny', 'Cloudy', 'Raining', 'Snowing']

def threeday_weather_report(weather):
  first_day = " Tomorrow the weather will be " + weather[0]
  second_day = " The following day it will be " + weather[1]
  third_day = " Two days from now it will be " + weather[2]
  return first_day, second_day, third_day
# This function takes in a set of data in the form of a list for the upcoming week’s weather. We can get our returned function values by assigning them to variables when we call the function:
monday, tuesday, wednesday = threeday_weather_report(weather_data)

print(monday)
print(tuesday)
print(wednesday)

# This will print: Tomorrow the weather will be Sunny  The following day it will be Sunny  Two days from now it will be Cloudy
