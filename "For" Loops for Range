# if we wanted to print out a "Learning Loops!" message six times using a for loop, we would follow this structure:
# for <temporary variable> in <list of length 6>:
#  print("Learning Loops!")
# for temp in range(6):
#  print("Learning Loops!")
# Learning Loops!
# Learning Loops!
# Learning Loops!
# Learning Loops!
# Learning Loops!
# Learning Loops!
for temp in range(6):
  print("Loop is on iteration number " + str(temp + 1))
# Would output: Loop is on iteration number 1
# Loop is on iteration number 2
# Loop is on iteration number 3
# Loop is on iteration number 4
# Loop is on iteration number 5
# Loop is on iteration number 6


 


promise = "I will finish the python loops module!"

for love in range(5):
  print(promise)
