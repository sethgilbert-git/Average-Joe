# Task 1: Put in a range from 0-8. Range containing numbers starting at 0 and up to, but not including, 9.
number_list = range(9)
# Task 2: convert that range into a list of numbers
print(list(number_list))
# Task 3: Create a range called zero_to_seven with the numbers 0 through 7.
zero_to_seven = range(8)
print(list(zero_to_seven))

# For example, range(2, 9) would generate numbers starting at 2 and ending at 8 (just before 9)
my_list = range(2, 9)
print(list(my_list))
# range(2, 9, 2) will give us a list where each number is 2 greater than the previous number:
my_range2 = range(2, 9, 2)
print(list(my_range2))
# Task 1: Modify the range() function that created the range range_five_three such that it:
range_five_three = range(5, 15, 3)
# Task 2: Starts at 0. Has a difference of 5 between each item. Ends before 40.
range_diff_five = range(0, 40, 5)
